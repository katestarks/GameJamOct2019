## Making code changes

The file `index.html` accesses the javascript and css files from this GitHub repository (master branch), so changing those files here does not require uploading to itch.io.

If a change is made that requires uploading to itch.io (such as modifying `index.html`), create a zip file containing all the relevant files and folders and upload it.

When testing changes locally, you will need to modify `index.html` to use the local files, otherwise any changes you make to javascript or css will have no effect.
